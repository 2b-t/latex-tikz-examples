# LaTeX examples

A couple of (animated) vector figures created with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ).

Currently this repository contains the following examples:

- An animated [**cosmological model of concentric spheres**](./EudoxusPlanetary.pdf) [(Eudoxus planetary model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentric_spheres). The interesting thing about this graphic is that it involves two coordinate transformations, one of which is performed manually.
- [Another one displays](./FluidScales.pdf) the **different scales of fluid models**. It demonstrates the usage of patterns and generation of random values.
- The principle of the [**Fourier analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis) is illustrated in [yet another file](./FourierAnalysis.pdf).
- [The last example](./StokesFormula.pdf) shows how the [**Stokes' law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_law) [can be derived by means of integration of stresses](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/537854/245414).
